Rune still have to synergize, even if it has high score. 

// Grading System
    1 Spd = 2 points so 6 Spd = 12 points 
    1 CR = 1.5 points so 5 CR = 8 points (round up)
    1 Atk% = 1 Def% = 1 Hp% = 1 CD = 1 point. 
    1 Acc = 0.5 or 1 point base on your needs and how much it synergizes with other stats.
    1 Res = 0 or 1 point base on how many rolls hit Res. High Res runes are desired, but the monsters they go are niche, so a rune that has Res is generally consider a dead stat. If it doesn't roll at least 2 times into Res, mark it as 0. 

*Flat stat - Skip for now 
    You can convert flat stats to a sort of 'average' of what it would be as a % of base. Or you can count them as 2-3% per roll and call it good.
    For quick reference: 10,000 HP, 750 ATK, and 600 DEF are slightly under average for base stats. Under average is best because few if any monsters will have all three of these stats this high.
    250 HP = 2.5% HP, 15 ATK = 2% ATK, 12 DEF = 2% DEF.

// Grading Base Rune
    Max points of 6* rune = 37 
    6 Spd + 6 CR + 8 Atk% + 8 Hp% = 12 + 9 + 8 + 8 = 37
    If have innate is 45 with 8 Def% or Acc 
    Min 6* Hero rune is 15 point = 5 Hp% + 5 Def% + 5 Atk% 
    Consider 15 points is Trash 
    
// Grading Upgraded Rune 
    Look for average increase > 6 per roll 
    Slot 1/ 3/ 5 might want 7 or more 
    Slot 2/ 4/ 6 have 6 is fine 

// Custom it yourself 
    General Guideline 
        Without innate:
            < 40 at +12 is SOLD 
            < 36 at +9 is SOLD 
            ~ 50 give or take a few 
            60 >= considered very good 
            > 70 is godlike 
    Late and End Game 
        Sell < 50 
        Search ~ 60
        Happy ~ 70

*Max Values (pre-grind and gem) - Skip for now 
    For a theoretical, "absolute" max (30 SPD, 6% CR, 8% ATK, 8% HP) would be 60 + 9 + 8 = 8 = 85. Including 8% DEF as an innate stat would be 93 (more realistically you'd probably want 7% CD innate, so it's 92). The odds of obtaining this rune are less than one in one trillion. I'm serious. That's why I call it theoretical. The odds of getting a rune comparable to the bullet points below are much more common, thus using THOSE as an actual ceiling is more reasonable.
    For realistic max for a Support/ Tank character, if we hold SPD to only rolling twice (to 18) and no CR%, then the max point value possible on a rune is 36 + 24 + 8 + 8 = 76. This would be like 18 SPD, 24% HP, 8% DEF, 8% ACC or RES.
    A semi-realistic max for a damage dealer for slot 1 or 5 would be 18 SPD, 18% CR, 8% ATK, 7% CD, which would be 36 + 8 + 27 + 7 = 78. A DEF- or HP-based DD would have the same value on slot 3 and 5, only with DEF% or HP% instead of ATK%.
