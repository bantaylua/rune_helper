Baseline of auto-sell						
	Rune 1* - 4*					
	White and Green quality					
	All subs are flat					
	4/6 only, Flat main, no spd					
	2 only, Flat main					
	5* blue (applicable only if GB10 & DB10 times are < 1:30)					
	5* 2/4/6 (applicable only if all B10 times are < 1:00, ignore if Speed main stat)					


Not in auto sell rule, I personally have five different categories:			
	Speed		
	Secondary Stats (CR, Acc, Res)		
	Offensive Power (CR, CD, Primary Stat)		
	'Primary Stat' here refers to HP% / Def% / Att%		
	Defensive Power (Def%, HP%, Res)		
	Support Power (HP%, Spd, Acc)		
Just for 1/3/5 - A decent baseline for these numbers is 15 Speed, 20% Secondary, and 25% Offense / Defense / Support Power if your B10 times are ~1:30.			
Also remember that a 5* Speed rune is nearly as valuable as a 6* one			
			
The beauty of this system is that you can adapt it to your needs, it's not just something for late or early game players.			
Did you just build your first GB10 team? Drop the 5* auto-sell conditions and lower the stat requirements to something like 12/15/20/20/20.			
Thinking about building a bomber team? Add a bomber condition (Att% / Acc / Spd) to the Offense Power category.			
Do you have a Defense based ToAH team? Add Def% to the Support Power category.			
Are you late in the game and you can’t sell any runes because they all match your conditions? Increase the numbers!			
I intentionally left out numbers from the flowchart because those values will vary between person to person. Each player’s game stage and monster box is unique, adapt to what works for YOU.			
Remember, Grindstones do NOT exist to fix a bad rune

2. Goal focus efficacy > Overall rune efficiency
3. There is no such thing as Mana
4. Rune Storage space > 4000+ . Store runes on monsters!

The most pickier		Slot 1/ 3 >	
More pickier		Slot 5	
Normal		Slot 2/ 4/ 6	

Slot 2/ 4/ 6 	Main Stats	% and SPD	Must be 6 Star except 5 star SPD 		
		Flat	Must be 6 Star with SPD in subs		
	Subs	Can have 1 flat and not roll into it			
		After +6 +9 +12 have pass value 			

A runes is good when it has been used, not in the storage
SO the problem here is we lack of many attackers
    > Therefore, we need a lot of runes has attack_sub stats 	
    > So we need to lower down our condition or just sell other runes ? 	
	    > We need to lower down our condition with attacker runes , and keep our condition for another runes 

So what is our condition?		
	1st of all, we not care about the flat stat	
	2nd	We not split runes into attacker runes and the other
	3rd	

Value slot 2/4/6 more than 1/3/5 as they are harder to get

auto sell blue on slot 1/3/5, and atk% and def% blue on slot 2/4/6

auto sell resist/acc main stat with no speed sub.

if i see resistance sub with flat stat, i’d auto sell (don't sell in case of hp% main stat)

If slot 1/3/5 does not have spd or cri rate sub stat and also doesn't have good innate, i’d sell

the same from point 5 applied to atk% and def% in slot 2/4/6 as well

efficiency on all slot needs to be than more 2 rolls, otherwise it wouldn’t be different than the blues that i sell.

The way i value 2/4/6 more than 1/3/5 means that in 1/3/5 slot, the cri rate or speed needs to be more than 2 rolls (more than 12), mean while in slot 2/4/6, only 1 roll is okay for me.

Legend 1/3/5 without speed/cri rate need to have more than 3 rolls efficiency.

Anything below 6* is sold unless its 5* legend with speed. But if it rolls anything else its instantly sold.

Below is a list of rules to follow by importance.

Legendary-With on Type Main and Sub Stats
Legendary-With on Type Main Stats
Legendary-With Speed or Crit Damage as Main Stats
Hero- With on Type Main or Sub Stats (2 or More Complementary Stats)
Rare- Slot 2 Speed Runes

Here are the rules for Selling

5 Stars-Sell, don't waste mana on these.
Blue Runes-Sell, aside from Speed exception*
Hero Flat stat- Sell if on slots 2,4,6.
Resistance or Accuracy-Sell but keep on or two for niche monsters.

First let's establish some rules regarding runes that always hold true:

If it has 6 SPD, is not slot 2, and is at least a purple quality 6* rune, you roll it until it stops rolling Speed. Doesn't matter the set, main stat, or other substats on the rune (it can be an ENERGY set, 6* purple with 6 SPD, 15 ATK and 13 DEF and you will still roll it until it doesn't roll SPD).

This still has a potential for 24 SPD. You need to roll any rune that has this potential, unless you are intensely end game, at least. (And even then there's an argument for it, honestly).

Up to you whether you want to roll a rune that has 4 SPD instead of 6. If it rolls 4 again, I'd stop rolling, though.

If it is Swift and has SPD at all (and not slot 2), you roll it until it misses SPD twice, no matter the set or main stat. Early on this even includes blue quality, though you can tighten that to purple later on as you start getting more and more runes that are 15+ SPD.

Until you have 2 runes in each slot that have 30 SPD (ungrinded) each, you don't have enough SPD. You will literally never obtain this level of quality. NOBODY in the entire game will, even those that have spent upwards of $100k on the game and have been playing since launch. Keep rolling SPD runes always.

If the slot is 2/4/6, and it is a 6* Legendary rune, is a desirable set (Violent, Swift, Will, Shield, among others), and has a desirable main stat (ATK%, HP% or SPD slot 2, HP% or CD% slot 4, HP% or ATK% slot 6), you NEVER sell this. You upgrade to +12, no matter the substats, and use reapps if it rolls into garbage.


First of all, we need a database.

We will be started at a new player. So we will have a lowest grade and quality of runes.

That will be a Normal 1 star runes then up to Legend 6 star runes.
