Sell_Roll_Rules
    Slot 2/ 4/ 6 have Main Stats is Flat and must be 5/ 6 Star with SPD in subs and pass the threshold 
    Rune with subs can have 1 flat and not roll into it	,after +6 +9 +12 have pass value threshold 
Exception_Rules
    If it has 6 SPD, != slot 2 and epic+ 6* rune, you roll it until it stops rolling Speed. Doesn't matter the set, main stat, or other sub stats on the rune (it can be an ENERGY set, 6* purple with 6 SPD, 15 ATK and 13 DEF and you will still roll it until it doesn't roll SPD).
    This still has a potential for 24 SPD. You need to roll any rune that has this potential, unless you are intensely end game, at least. (And even then there's an argument for it, honestly).
    If it is Swift and has SPD at all (and not slot 2), you roll it until it misses SPD twice, no matter the set or main stat. Early on this even includes blue quality, though you can tighten that to purple later on as you start getting more and more runes that are 15+ SPD.
    Until you have 2 runes in each slot that have 30 SPD (un-grinded) each, you don't have enough SPD. You will literally never obtain this level of quality. NOBODY in the entire game will, even those that have spent upwards of $100k on the game and have been playing since launch. Keep rolling SPD runes always.
    If the slot is 2/4/6, and it is a 6* Legendary rune, is a desirable set (Violent, Swift, Will, Shield, among others), and has a desirable main stat (ATK%, HP% or SPD slot 2, HP% or CD% slot 4, HP% or ATK% slot 6), you NEVER sell this. You upgrade to +12, no matter the sub stats, and use re-apps if it rolls into garbage.

// Rule Sell of Human being 
For slots 2/4/6, the star is more important than the grade.
For slots 1/3/5, the rune grade is more important.
The most pickier    Slot 1/ 3 >	
More pickier        Slot 5	
Normal              Slot 2/ 4/ 6
Auto sell blue on slot 1/3/5, and atk% and def% blue on slot 2/4/6
Auto sell resist/acc main stat with no speed sub.
if i see resistance sub with flat stat, i’d auto sell (don't sell in case of hp% main stat)
If slot 1/3/5 does not have spd or cri rate sub stat and also doesn't have good innate, i’d sell
Anything below 6* is sold unless its 5* legend with speed. But if it rolls anything else its instantly sold.
